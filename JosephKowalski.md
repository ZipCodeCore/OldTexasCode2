I choose the string code sample. It displays various ways to manipulate strings. The first string is just a simple assignment of "Computer Science" string. 
The second string adds a number on to the end of the first string that would look like "Computer Science 307". The third string takes part of the end of 
the string which would print out "cience". The fourth string assigns "is fun" to the string variable. The fifth string combines the second and the fourth 
string to make "Computer Science 307is fun". The sixth string adds to numbers and add the string "total" on the end to make "8total". The seventh string puts
the "total " string in front of the addition of two numbers to make the string "total 35". The last string adds a space string " " in front of the addition of
two numbers then adds the string "total" to the end which would make the final string " 35total". The code sample shows some simple string manipulation and
how string can be used with numbers.
