First part of the code defaults the total sides of the die to 6.
Exception variable "Die" asks for the number of sides and must be greater than 1. 
Likes 63 to 69 is the roll, where it generates a random number between the 1 and the number of sides entered. 
73 to 79 checks the sides of the die. Lines 83 and 90 checks the "current rolled value".
